<h3><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Why a paper edit?</span></h3><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When you are at the post production stage, with all your rushes, and the idea of diving into them and making sense of it, to create a rough assembly can be quiet daunting. regardless of whether you are passing them on to an editor or weather you're going to do the edit yourself.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />Weather you have a Shooting Script you’ve worked with to collect the material, or weather it’s a more explorative “observational” type of documentary, the paper edit workflow can help you make sense of your rushes and craft stronger narratives.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br /></span><h3><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A few consideration on the value of doing a Paper Edit</span></h3><h2></h2><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However the paper edit key value is that of of being able to isolate the content.<br />Working with transcripts, concentrating on the meaning, removing non verbal communication. <br />This is common practice in social sciences and psychotherapy were they work with transcripts on a daily basis. And have developed all sorts of techniques to analyses transcripts for meaning, ie how many time a certain word is repeated in a certain context might indicate certain things rather than others.<br /><br />In a nutshell a paper edit is “a script upside down” or at least it would appear so, as we start from material we have already collected (transcriptions) to build up the “paper edit script” for the editor rough assembly.<br />&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However as for film script best practice is to “write from the outside in, rather than the other way a round.”(<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Story-Substance-Structure-Principles-Screenwriting/dp/0413715604/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351768731&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">McKee 1999, p.410</a>) which means to work out the outline first and then fill in the dialogue and descriptions.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br />With the Paper edit workflow as described above, you can still do just that. Only your working point rather then being a writer’s research into the topic and characters he as developed, it’s the transcript you have, and how you categories this material to create a working outline that will become the backbone of your final paper edit.<br />Once you have a paper edit, you would then either pass it on to your editor, or ingest into final cut yourself to see how that assembly looks on screen.<br /></span>
