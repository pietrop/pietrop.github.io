In Photographic cameras, in manual mode, you can set exposure, the amount of light that reaches the sensor by changing Shutter, Aperture and ISO the so called Exposure Triangle. 

And with different settings you obtain different effect, the main idea is that, first you decide what kind of picture you want to take and then you set those accordingly. Main considerations you want to think about are: do you want to freeze motion or blur it? or do you want your shallow or greater depth of field?


# Exposure Triangle: Shutter, Aperture, ISO.

## ISO

It's the density of the pixels. it comes from when on film you had to chose different rols of films depending on the aviability of light you were forecasting for the shoot, and they would have thicker or wider space between the celluloid.

at Iso 100 the pixelles are packed togethere, and is harder for the light to get trough.
at iso 1600 pixells are further apart, better for low light, but pourer quality, los of clour and sharpnees.
as RGB, colour scheme, Red, Green and Blue pixells, pulls apart at higher iso. 

Rule of thumb: Keep ISO as low as possible. ISO 100 is idea, to be used at all time, but if lower light and already adjuster shutter and Aperture, you can go higher with the ISO.
Generally for studio photography and portraits it would be 100 or 200 max, while for photojournalism you can go higher if circumstances require as it doesn't matter as much.

In the example above, the picture was taken at very high ISO, as to capture the moment quickly the photographer put the camera in P mode (program mode, where the camera decides all of the 3 variable, Shutter, Aperture, ISO, and because of the low light it set itself to high ISO).


## Aperture 

The aperture mechanism is into the lens, it's measured in f stop, f. 

Lower number wider aperture:
F2 wide, let's a lot of light. 
f16 - f22-f32 smaller, not a lot of light in

Prime lenses the lack of zoom mechanism allows more space for the optic, and can have wider aperture, and therefore let more light in.


## Shutter Speed

Amount of time the shutter is open. 
ie range on 5D MK1 is 30" to 1/8000 sec
1/1000 is faster then 1/30.

Faster Shutter freezes action. and it's relative to the speed of the action.
ie 1/125 someone walking.
ie 1/1000 formula one.
ie water 1/1000

to the extent of capturing things the human eye can't see, with such clarity, ie a drop. (1/8 000 of a sec)

Slow Shutter speeds makes motion blurred.
1" 1/4 1/15  1/30

when you reach the camera limits you can ad an ND filter, and that gives you a couple of f stops more. (it's equivalent of sunglasses for a camera).

ie for  capturing blurred flow of water on a river.

ie to get lighting, exposure of 20 to 30 seconds.

or a more creative use of slow shutter speed is for instance if you fire flash at end, you can have the tiral of someone running.

if you want to go even slower, there is a bulb function that allows you open and close the shutter manually, if you want to go for even longer exposures time then the one available.

ie f2.8 , 3.5hour iso 40 , 17mm lens.

# Aesthetics and Reciprocity of the Exposure triangle: Aperture, Shutter, ISO.

The main things that can be controlled to do with the exposure triangle, to set the aesthetics of a picture are: Shallow or Greater Depth of field, Freeze or blur motion.  Or even combine this two sets of variables.

Trough setting Aperture first you can set a Shallow or a Greater Depth of field,

## Aperture
Prioratising Aperture, for Shallow or Greater Depth of field
f2 - 1/1000 
f8 - 1/8 
f22 - 1/6

They give all the same exposure.

## Shutter Speed
While Prioritising Shutter speed you can decide weather you want to Freeze or blur motion

However 1/500 f3.5 freezes motion, 
while 1/15  f20 blurs motion.


## Iso
when one of these settings doesn't allow to set the other one to obtain the wanted result, you can adjust the ISO as last resort to accommodate the aesthetic you are trying to achieve.

# Understanding and using the Camera Light meter to set the exposure triangle

on a dslr looks like this, on a pro-compact (ie G12) it's horizontal rather then vertical.

When you half press the shutter to focus lock, the curson moves and shows wheather the picture is over exposed (+1 to +2) or under exposed (-1 to -2).

	<a href="/images/photography101/light-meter.jpg"><img src="/images/photography101/light-meter.jpg"></a>
	<small>Light meter</small> </a></figcaption>
</figure>

Rule of thumb: aim to set at -1, under expose by one stop.

How to use light meter:

	evaluative metering</small> </a> </figcaption>
</figure>

1- point camera at subject
set exposure to evaluative metering

2- Check light meter by half pressing the shutter to focus lock.
and see if camera light meter shows you to be over or under exposed.
Then set Shutter and Aperture, to get light meter to zero.

3 prioratise Shutter or Aperture.
depending on weather your primary objective is freezing / blurring action OR Shallow / Greather depth of fied, set first the shutter OR the Aperture and adjust the  other one accordingly to balance the light meter to zero.

3.1 Adjust shutter. (on DSLR front wheel)
- ie not lower then 1/60 for hand held, 
- higher then 1/250 for freezing action,
- between 1/20 and 1/10 for blurred effect ie panning effect.

3.2  Adjust aperture. (on DSLr Back Wheel)
- set F2 for shallow depth of field (blurred background)
- set  higher f stop, like f16 or higher for greater depth of field (everything in focus)


4 Iso
- have it at 100
- but as a last resort if light meter, stil under exposed, set ISO to center the light meter to zero.


## Camera Simulator
if you are still puzzled about the exposure triangle and using the light meter to set exposure, there is a camera simulator app for iphone, that also works from the browser ( link )
which is worth giiving it a try to test out the exposure triangle (Aperture, Shutter, ISO) in relation to understanding and using the light meter, to set exposure correctly.

<iframe src="http://camerasim.com/embed/camera-simulator/" frameborder="0" width="550" height="570" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  
it has 3 example, best of which is probably the waterfall once, you can change shutter speed and aperture accordingly to try out the blurred and freeze action effect.

## DOF - Depth of Field

	f4.5  - 1/30 - 140mm -Iso 100 - Canon G12
understanding factors that influence depth of field.</a></figcaption>
</figure>


1. Aperture,
 as seen above, lower number, ie f2 wider aperture , shallower depth of field
2. focal lenght,
ie at 100mm, tele end of zoom lens, is more accuanted then at 24mm, the wider end.
3. Distance
relative distance to subject.
 - first of all if possible zoom in
- then get camera closer to the subject
- and align so that the object and background further away.





## For all in focus (greater depth of field) 

<figure>

	f14 - 1/30 - 47mm - iso50 Canon 5D MKIII</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Do the opposite,
- f11 or higher.
- and if possible limit background.

Useful for landscapes.




# Some techniques that use the exposure triangle principles


## Panning effect - How to

<figure>

	Shutter 1/30 -Aperture f14 - ISO50 - Focal length105mm - Canon 5D MKIII</a></figcaption>
</figure>


- Set to a slower shutter to 1/30 or 1/20 or 1/10.

- set focus to AI Servo, this will refocus in the background, 
rather the one shoot focus,which focus locks, and is good for recomposing the shoot but not for tracking an object like in this case.

	Shutter 1/30 -Aperture f14 - ISO50 - Focal length105mm - Canon 5D MKIII</a></figcaption>
</figure>



- Set to multiple shoot 

- Set exposure to evaluative, rather then spot.


- and follow a moving object like a car or a person.

 



## Silhouette effect

</figure>


Position yourself opposite to the subject and the external light source, with light source behind the subject. ie sun.

- set camera to spot meetering.(this reads 1% of the frame only where the red dot is)
- meter on the sky/light source, and set aperture and shutter to get camera lightmeter to zero or lower.
- frame subject and focus, without chaning other settings, and there you go it should be a silouette.

 

 

## Painting with light

<br>
Picasso invented/discovered, painting with light in photography. 

- set a long exposure, in a dark enviroment, 
- wide aperture, 
- low iso, 
- and use a torch to draw something in the air.

Michael Bosanko is another example of someone who uses this technique extensively.


## Last but not least

With the awarness of the things above looking at pitures, you can now read them thinking
was this shoot on low or fast shutter speed? wide or close aperture? what focal length was it(zoomed in or out)? 
This will help you to decode pictures you like and familiarise with the technique used, and consolidate and  build a vocabulary.
