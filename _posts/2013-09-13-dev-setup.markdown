# Text Editor: Sublime Text
a Text Editor, like [**SublimeTxt2**](<https://www.sublimetext.com>) is a good choise, other options are Vim, textmate,  textwrangler. Sublime is not free, but the version you download does not stop working after trial is expired, it just keeps reminding you to buy it every once on a while, but if you are on a budget it will do just fine.
