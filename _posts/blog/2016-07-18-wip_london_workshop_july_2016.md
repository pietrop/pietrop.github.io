On Saturday July 9th 2016 I run a hands on workshop titled "How to craft compelling stories out of video interviews?". This was in collaboration with [Niels Ladefoged](https://twitter.com/insofar_media) who has been curating the [Whistle Blower Interview Project](https://vimeo.com/whistleblowers) in collaboration with [the centre for investigative journalism in London](http://www.tcij.org/whistleblowers/whistleblower-interview-project).

This was the [description of the workshop on eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-craft-compelling-stories-out-of-video-interviews-hands-on-workshop-tickets-25940608057#).

>Using some of the videos from the Whistle Blowers Interview Archive, weâ€™ll take an hands on approach to explore key concepts, ideas and techniques to identify narrative points, test out story ideas, and craft a compelling story.

>This workshop focusses on the underlying evergreen storytelling principles that transcend the medium, so no knowledge of video editing required, just curiosity towards story telling principles and techniques.

>Participants will be divided into groups of 3 to 4 people. The aim for each group is to produce a 3 to 5 minutes video, given 3 short video interviews (roughly 15 min each) accompanied by their corresponding time-coded transcriptions.

>Key story telling principles and techniques will be introduced to facilitate the process.

>The aim of the workshop is for the participants to gain an hands on insight into the process of interviewed based documentary story crafting rather then producing a polished final product.

These were the [slides]({{page.slides}}) used for the workshop.

The key idea was to guide the participant to an old school (paper, scissors and tape) paper-edit while introducing key story crafting concepts from relevant literature and personal experience.  

We provided paper transcriptions for interviews, roughly an hour each, with

-  Jesselyn Radack [pdf]({{page.transcriptions_jr}})
- Thomas Drake [pdf]({{page.transcriptions_td}})
- Annie Machon [pdf]({{page.transcriptions_am}})


As well as a [link to web version mobile responsive interactive transcription of the interview]({{page.web_version_interviews_link}}) altho participants were strongly encouraged to work of the paper transcriptions.

I was very impressed with how everyone was incredibly switched on, and the groups worked together bouncing ideas of each other in a very collaborative spirit.

At the end of the workshop we showed what one of the paper-edit from one of the groups would have looked like as a video sequence.

To assemble the sequence from their paper-edit within the time constraints I used a version of my first attempt at making a [digital paper-editing software](/autoEdit.html).
