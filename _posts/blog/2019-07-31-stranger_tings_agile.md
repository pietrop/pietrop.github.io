<!-- Spoiler disclaimer  -->

## 1. Start with the end in mind

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

Season 2 was thought of from the start with the snowball as the conclusion of the last episode.

<div class="image-wrapper">

</div>

> We always had that moment with Dustin and Nancy.You have these ideas in mind, like the snow ball dance, which then become the building blocks, and that scene, is one of the pieces that goes up on the board, and you are like, that’s staying no matter what. And how do we get there?

While the kiss between max and Lucas, was decided on the day.

## 2. Use Placeholders (characters)

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image4 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

The Bob character took shape and prominence over time, in ways that was not initially anticipated

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image5 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

Largely due to the actor’s interpretation of the character

## 3. Anticipate change

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image6 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

> These are two of the best example of actors informing characters. You were dealing with 13 major characters, and so some are more formed then others. Dusting and Steven are two that were just stereotypes, they were almost like place holders, until we met Gaten, and we were like that’s interesting. How do you write for Gaten? You can’t create the character Gaten, there’s only one.

## 4. Respond to change

The growl by dustin - originally was a chewbacca impersonation!

Steve storyline came to a halt, so they decided to pair him with Dustin.

</div>

They had many scene options on how they came across one and other and then picked one, the flower scene.

## 5. Orchestrate change

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image9 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

The evolution of the Steve carather’s from an 80’s jock wasn't initially anticipated. Then as he became more charming and likeable → the writers realised when writing season 1, that they wanted to give it more of an arc. And not just negative one dimension.
To achieve that, they made last minute change - Steve goes back in the house and saves the day.

TODO: change image, eg steve, saving the day in the house split screen with steve at beginning of the season,. -->

## 6. Start small and be practical

of work not done--is essential.

in season 1, the CG department was 1 person part time. A lot of the effects done with props and costumes to be practical.
This affected the design of the demagorg monster, because it was guy in a suit, on mini stilt.

## 7. Scale up (resources) when is time

While in season 2 there was a whole department of CGI people. Eg junkyard scene, nothing around steve character. vs Eg season one steve, hitting guy in a suite with a bath.
