A proof concept built at [Vax 2016 (Voxâ€™s hackaton)](https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/at-voxs-latest-hackathon-devs-focus-on-the-distributed-web-brand-identity-and-user-accessibility/) as part of a Vox team.

It tried to answer the question "What would internet stories look like if newspapers and magazines never existed?"


<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

The idea is that if you had an `#` tag for twitter it could give you a visual flow of images shared across a timeline, with a representation of retweets to get a sense of the flow over time.  As well as to explore user generated content, where images are manipulated or modified with comments and then re-posted.

Clicking on an image takes you to more details on the source tweet.

    <img src="{{ page.image2 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

Best explained in the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkKJsJj0JjP8vbY1l9iV6j9GJnTYW-UAnF5PNHTLmDU/edit?usp=sharing) of the project.
