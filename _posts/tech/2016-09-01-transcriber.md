_draft: more coming soon_

Purpose of this working prototype was to test whether users(and which user segment) would be accepting of the quality of the speech to text service by IBM Watson. Before introducing [autoEdit 2](http://pietropassarelli.com/autoEdit2.html)

It's not a production ready app, but rather a throwaway intermediate project. Altho users kept using it until the introduciton of autoEdit2, you can read [more about this process here](https://source.opennews.org/articles/video-editing-made-better-introducing-autoedit/).
