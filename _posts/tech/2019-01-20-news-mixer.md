Expanding and taking a step further the idea from [OneStory at BBC #newsHack](/oneStory.html).

It's common for stories to be reversioned across medium. 

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image2 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

Across video, audio and text. Sometime this is planned upfront, other times it's done only if it gets traction in one of these medium.

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image3 }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

We considered the variety of learning styles, as explined by [V.A.R.K.](https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire)

</div>

As well as how media consuption habits might change during the day depnding on circumstances and sourroundings. 
For instance a commuter might want to engage with a story first by listening to it on the way to the tube, watching it while they are on the train, and reading the rest once they get to work.

</div>

Or they might start by reading while getting their coffee, listening to it while driving to work, and watching the rest once they have arrived to the office.

This story format explored people's preferences when consuming multimedia content.

Investigating whether there's value in being able to switch between the three different mode, audio, video and text in a chapterised story.
