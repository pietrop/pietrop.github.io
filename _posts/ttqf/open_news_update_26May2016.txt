Open News update

- First npm package, srt parser / composer
	- 30 downloads in the first 21 hours.
	- https://www.npmjs.com/package/srt_parser_composer
	- https://github.com/pietrop/srtParserComposer
	- Is missing proper tests, and error messages.
	- Any feedback on code, or documentation or anything could be done better/differently very welcome.
	- at the moment it can also export to CSV.
	- haven’t implemented CSV to srt, as don’t have a use case for it, and is slightly tricky, but if there’s interest  get in touch and I am happy to look into it.

- Open sourced, first working iteration of Speech To Text transcriber, os x desktop app, using IBM Watson Speech to text.
	- check it out. project page has instructions on how to get setup if you want to use it/try it.
	- doing user testing a round quality of transcriptions and what people use to edit them (google docs? word? youtube captioning? etc..)

- Looking into a tool for burning subtitles onto video for facebook/twitter
	- have a component that does that, doing user testing/gathering requirements.
