<p>On Saturday July 9th 2016 I run a hands on workshop titled “How to craft compelling stories out of video interviews?”. This was in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/insofar_media">Niels Ladefoged</a> who has been curating the <a href="https://vimeo.com/whistleblowers">Whistle Blower Interview Project</a> in collaboration with <a href="http://www.tcij.org/whistleblowers/whistleblower-interview-project">the centre for investigative journalism in London</a>.</p>

<p>This was the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-craft-compelling-stories-out-of-video-interviews-hands-on-workshop-tickets-25940608057#">description of the workshop on eventbrite</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using some of the videos from the Whistle Blowers Interview Archive, we’ll take an hands on approach to explore key concepts, ideas and techniques to identify narrative points, test out story ideas, and craft a compelling story.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This workshop focusses on the underlying evergreen storytelling principles that transcend the medium, so no knowledge of video editing required, just curiosity towards story telling principles and techniques.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Participants will be divided into groups of 3 to 4 people. The aim for each group is to produce a 3 to 5 minutes video, given 3 short video interviews (roughly 15 min each) accompanied by their corresponding time-coded transcriptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Key story telling principles and techniques will be introduced to facilitate the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The aim of the workshop is for the participants to gain an hands on insight into the process of interviewed based documentary story crafting rather then producing a polished final product.</p>
