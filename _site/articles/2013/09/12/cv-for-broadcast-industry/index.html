<hr>
<p>Every Industry has it’s conventions for CVs. Now I am no expert, but these are<br />
some of the things I’ve gathered researching on how to do my own cv and getting<br />
feedbacks on it, talking with people who have experience in the industry,<br />
attending master classes, and reading books about it, so thought I’d share it in<br />
case anyone has anything they’d like to add to it.</p>

<p>What follows is the basic’s I’ve gathered  to draft a broadcast CV.</p>

<h1 id="what-you-are-going-to-need">What you are going to need?</h1>

<p>First, things first, what are you going to need ot get started?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll need to research what is the job description and key skills of the<br />
type of job opportunities you are looking for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then you need to look at how these skills apply to your experience, and how<br />
your work experience can be used to showcase these skills with practical<br />
examples.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To Research the job description you could do that looking at a range of adverts<br />
for the same type of position, and make notes of the main points of the job<br />
description, or look at some books or blogs on this topic.  Here is a few good<br />
sources worth having a look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.theunitlist.com/download-tipsheet-for-tv-runners">Unit list TV Runner tipsheet</a> pdf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-Job-Television-Professional/dp/1408101297/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350068178&amp;sr=8-1">How to Get a Job in Television</a> Book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://bit.ly/Q1m49M">An Experts Guide to Getting into TV</a> Book.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then once you’ve researched those and have comprehensive list it can be useful<br />
to brainstorm how those apply to you, for instance making a chart with example<br />
of previous work experience that illustrate those points.</p>

<h1 id="main-sections-of-a-cv">Main sections of a CV:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Name and Lastname</li>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Contact Details</li>
  <li>Profile</li>
  <li>Key Skills</li>
  <li>Current Employment</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Other Courses/Education</li>
  <li>References</li>
</ul>

<p>There are of course other sections you could have, such as “Interests and<br />
Hobbies” and you could have “Current”, “previous” and “Other” employment all in<br />
one section, or omit one or the other depending on how your tailoring your cv.</p>

<p>And this is exactly the main point, your CV needs to be tailored to the specific<br />
type of job you are applying to. What follows are not some hard and fast rules<br />
to live by, they are just principles that most employer seems to agree upon.</p>

<p>However considering the average employer spends less than 6 seconds per cv, this<br />
really call for a well layed out, cv easy to skim through. Where the layout<br />
makes the most relevant information stand out, and leave an impression. Sounds<br />
like a lot to achieve, putting the last 3 or 4 years of your experiences  in one<br />
or two pages? let’s have a closer look at it.</p>

<p>What follows is meant to be an explanation of the sections of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwdlhrSSXSiEQmw4MC1KWHV1R0E/edit?usp=sharing">CV Template I’ve made.</a></p>

<h3 id="name-and-lastname">Name and Lastname</h3>

<p>In theory, No nick name, just your name and surname as is on your passport.</p>

<h3 id="title">Title</h3>

<p>Most of the time it’s highly recommended to put your job title at the top near<br />
your name, as employers will want to know what you do very quickly, and not have<br />
to figure it out reading the all of the cv.</p>

<p>(if you need some convincing scroll down to the end section.)</p>

<h3 id="contact-details">Contact Details</h3>

<h3 id="e-mail-adress">E-mail adress</h3>

<p>Make sure your e-mail address has got your name in it, it helps remember it.</p>

<p>if yourname.yourlastname@something is taken, then you can consider<br />
yourname.lastname.tv@ or whatever else.. seems appropriate.</p>

<p>Gmail generally inspires more credibility, but I guess this is debatable. But<br />
avoiding using unprofessional e-mail addresses like drunkenstupid@hotmail.com</p>

<p>tip: if you have a address you already use but would like a more pro sounding<br />
one , and can’t be asked to check two addresses all the time, with gmail, you<br />
can set up a [e-mail delegation5 and/or a forwarder6, so that you can check your<br />
new e-mail from the old address. ]</p>

<p>5http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=138350</p>

<p>6http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=10957</p>

<h3 id="www">WWW</h3>

<p>Strongly recommend to have a website, for portfolio and/or Showreel.</p>

<p>However do not go overboard, keep it simple, to the point, and a very arsh<br />
selection of your best work only.</p>

<p>[I’ll write more about showreel in a separate post]</p>

<h3 id="phone-number">Phone Number</h3>

<p>Pretty self explanatory,</p>

<p>tip:  if you are dissatisfied with your current carrier I recommend [giffgaff7 ]</p>

<p>7http://giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/pietrops</p>

<h3 id="address">Address</h3>

<p>Personally I think it doesn’t need to have a civic number etc.. I reckon is just<br />
enough to have city and country, unless relevant for the job applied or<br />
specified in the job description as requirement.</p>

<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>

<p>Profile or short personal statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First sentence describes you in a nutshell.ie Sociology graduate, with keen<br />
interest in factual entertainment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then write about what is important for you. ie attentions for details,<br />
and/or organised and methodical,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And specify experience you have, this should summaries the skills that are<br />
  in the employment sections using key/buzz wors, ie “ managing talents”,<br />
  “recce locations,” 2 to 3 lines max.</p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-skills">Key Skills</h3>

<p>Bullet point is best, as they are easy to scroll through, skim and scan. I would<br />
put max 5 key skills that are most relevant, some of the categories are :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>camera skills and camera known,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>editing skills and editing platforms known,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other post production software</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>languages, with level of competence(of course only worth mentioning if any<br />
other than english.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>archive clearance, and other..</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>driving licence</p>

<h4 id="crb-check">CRB check</h4>

<p>Ofcourse these will depend on the key points of the job description previously<br />
researched, but an example of the once above would look like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Confident Shooter (naming camera models, ie Sony ex1/ex3, Sony Canon<br />
Xf100/Xf300, Sony PW500, Canon C300 and DSLRS 5D MkII)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proficient editor with FCP / Avid, Sound mixing with Protools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fluent in Italian (mother-tongue) , French and English</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Archive clearance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full clean driving licence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>

<p>Employment could be subdivided in current employment, previous employment, other<br />
employment, but keep it to the point, and keep all your TV/Broadcast work<br />
together.</p>

<p>If you have them you can list your credits, in a format like this one, bold and<br />
bullet points help scanning the cv more quickly:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Your job        Name of production company / Name of Broadcast Month/Year
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One to two line max describing the gist of the programme and include name of<br />
production.</p>

<p>And then bullet point relevant skills, Two to 3 point max per each job,</p>

<p>Do not repeat same points in different jobs, showcase a variety of skills and<br />
achievements relevant to the job description.</p>

<p>If you are relatively junior, you could briefly mention tasks that were<br />
delegated to you by a more senior person.</p>

<p>If you have credits on adverts, promos or corporate you can list the brands or<br />
bands, in a separate section.</p>

<p>If you don’t have broadcast credits, tne you can use the same format to list<br />
transferable skills from other type employment, work experience etc.. aiming to<br />
make the point you have the skills and experience for the next step, ie runner,<br />
junior researcher etc..</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>Brief list your education, in bullet points, in chronological order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Any Master or further postgraduate studies,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Degree</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>High School, with number of GCSEs and grades and same for A levels.</p>

<p>if not done in the UK, it’s not necessary to put grade, just put in the one line<br />
description that the qualification was equivalent to GCSEs and A levels</p>

<p>I think the following format works well:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>BA Name,                       Name of University, Month Year
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One line description of major achievements, ie sound installation, graduation<br />
film, dissertation etc…</p>

<h3 id="other-courses">Other Courses</h3>

<p>Last but not least, before the references, you can have a section with relevant<br />
training,</p>

<p>any certificates, master classes, or short courses.</p>

<p>Name of course Month Year</p>

<p>One line description.</p>

<p>Some examples of courses that are highly regarded are First Aid, Health &amp;<br />
Safety, and the Hostile Environment training.</p>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>

<p>Rather than the usual “available on request” I would suggest to list your<br />
references and update them as you progress, but I guess there are no hard and<br />
fast rules on this.</p>

<p>Remember to check with the person you are putting down as reference, that they<br />
are ok with it, before you do so.</p>

<h1 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h1>

<p>Do some research, the source section at the end of this post is a good starting<br />
point.</p>

<p>See what works for you, get some feedbacks from industry people and re-adjust<br />
accordingly.</p>

<p>See how other people have made their CV, in site such as Production base<br />
(monthly or yearly fee) or other diary services (Callbox, etc..) you can see<br />
user’s CV, now these are not necessarily good examples, but it can help for<br />
ideas, and judge what works for you.</p>

<h1 id="final-appendix-on-the-title-section">Final appendix on the title section</h1>

<p>This should be realistic, if you are at an entry level stage of your career, or<br />
still very junior in your field, you might wanna wait till when you are finished<br />
with the rest of the CV.</p>

<p>As the experience and job titles you have in the employment section might give<br />
you clues for</p>

<p>the most appropriate one, that balances between your future expectations and the<br />
stage you are currently at.</p>

<p>In other words, “Film-maker” is too vague a term, and there is no point in<br />
writing “Director” or “Producer” if you don’t have director Broadcast credits on<br />
your cv. In the employes view this shows a lack of understanding of the<br />
industry’s culture and dynamics.</p>

<p>Now, there is a lot of debates around this, and all I am saying is be aware that<br />
should you do this, you wouldn’t be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Having said that, there is nothing wrong, if you really want to, to ad a section<br />
called “Personal Projects” where you have some of the short films you worked on,<br />
But only if the topics, skills or the job title are relevant for the position<br />
you are applying for.</p>

<p>So, you stand a better chance of employment if you write “runner”</p>

<p>or “Runner / Researcher”, if you are at entry level, with no broadcast credits,<br />
but feel like you have the skills, and can demonstrate that in the previous<br />
employment section.</p>

<p>I know what a lot of view are going to say now, “I don’t want to work as a<br />
runner” and my personal view, is you don’t necessarily have to. But what you do<br />
have to understand is, that it all revolves around “How much money have you been<br />
trusted with?”.</p>

<p>Sure, you might think that having worked on a number of short films for the last<br />
couple of years you feel ready to receive more responsibility.  But my advise is<br />
“walk before you run” and “slowly but steady”. having used a couple of thousands<br />
pounds at best,  to make a very low budget short, weather for yourself, for a<br />
charity or other type of organisation. Requires very good skills in making the<br />
most of very little resources, But it’s not the same as working on a doc or a<br />
factual entertainment series where the budget is a round or even over 100 000<br />
pounds and a potential mistake on your part could cost a lot of money to be<br />
fixed, as generally the quick turnaround makes this things more expensive.</p>

<p>Therefore, a entry level position like a “runner” or “junior researcher”(which<br />
is arguably not considered as such) would give you a good amount of<br />
responsibility, but still with a chance to observe what is going on around you<br />
to learn and be ready for the next step when it’ll happen.</p>
