<p>Pitching for factual/documentary stories.<br />
Why pitch? a side from the obvious(ie commissions) pitching is a great tool to formulate and articulate the idea, and condense it’s facets into a compelling story.</p>

<p>The process of making the pitch concise also helps in the further development of the story through pre-production production and post production and distribution. What follows are my notes, I gathered when I was preparing a pitch for the C4 Trainee scheme and BBC PTS application, which is in the examples after each part. This pitch in both cases it got me to the interview stage.</p>

<h1 id="pitch---written-paragraph">Pitch - Written paragraph</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good idea is often based on passion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>

<h3 id="narrative-what-drives-the-journey---carachter-and-inciting-icident">1-Narrative, what drives the journey? - carachter and inciting icident.</h3>

<p>What is the inciting icident that sets the journey in motion unbalances the protagonist life and makes him/her want to restore it?
and while doing that try to delineate who is the caracther and how is he empathetic?</p>

<p>Answer this in two sentences.  If not is likely that either your story too complicated, or you need to do more research to get a clearer idea of what it is interest you about it.</p>

<p>Sell the idea on its own merits, not on adjectives.</p>

<p>Think also in terms of Topline.</p>

<p>especially you are creating a setup type of scenario that sets the narrative in motion for a factual type of programme, you could think of carachters seriously considering changing their lives, and mark setting up project challenges for them. Think kind of people you would cast, people you would like to see on screen and how journey might effect them?<!--  See post on [casting](<coming soon>) for more on how to identify compelling carachters for factual programmes. --></p>

<p>Think Robert Mckee, inciting incident, an event the sets the rest of the story in motion. 
The rest of the story tends spit open the gap the protagonist expirience between his/her expectations and reality.</p>

<div class="well">
<p>Can you live for free for a month? Mark Boyle hasn’t used money for 3 years, and now lives “for free.”  He is the moneyless man.</p>
<p> Mark will guide four individuals with money problems wanting to make a change as we explore the upcoming trend of the gift economy.</p>
<p>Kips (35) worked for 10 years as IT consultant, is tired of facing a computer screen every day, and wants more face time with people. Meg (32) is a Yoga teacher, aspiring permaculturist, wanting to live off the grid. Jeremy (27) is a freelance photographer struggling to cover his expenses. Ashley (15) is a spoiled teenager, whose parents have told him they can’t afford to send him to uni.</p>
</div>

<p>Another technique is to use quote from things your contributors would say.
ie Mark sayd he “replaced money with relationship people and the hart”.
or “make up” the cast, delineating their carachteristics, setup the conflict so that in the their head the reader can infer what they will find difficult.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-we-see">2-What will we see?</h3>
<p>What will be in in it? obstacles complicaions, twist, reversal. </p>

<div class="well">
<p>They will give up on their commodities and ease of access to things, and go moneyless for a month, under Mark Guidance.
They will discover how to grow their own food, make meaningful relationship with people around them to exchange what they need. They’ll be taught bushcraft skills to look after themselves with minimal reliance on equipment and maximum reliance on skills and knowledge of nature.</p>
<p>They will be introduced to the world of the gift economy, and help to build an off the grid "free house".
Will they succeed? How will this experience change them? Will they continue after Mark’s coaching, and if so how will they get on? At a time when money is losing its value, with exclusive access to Mark, we’ll find out what it means to go moneyless.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="why-we-doing-it">3-Why we doing it?</h3>

<p>The “so what?” question, relevance and meaning, position the idea/story into a wider context, ie make connections with current trends.
Why will it make a good programme? does it capture the zeigeist(sprit) of current times? does it resonate with universal archeotypes but is also relevant to today’s issues? if so what are those issues and how does it tackles them? how does it sudgests a new angle on them?</p>

<div class="well">
<p>Most people consider individuality as being able to stand on your own two feet financially, and not needing others. Mark advocates the exact opposite. For him the way to go is to establish as many relationships of mutual exchange with the people that surround us as possible, rather then relying on savings in the bank. Effectively setting up a gift economy.</p>
<p>In a time of financial crisis we explore what money really means to us, and what  it implies to take part in a gift economy.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="what-are-we-exploring">4-What are we exploring?</h3>
<p>The theme, underlying theme,
for instance</p>

<div class="well">
<p>The upcoming trend of gift economy, forces us to rethink our individuality in relation to the society we live in and the people a round us. Money and it's inpersonality his replaced with barater, skills sharing, exchange and mutual help.
What does this contrast, and the difficult we'd find in making such a transition have to say about our world? </p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2 id="other-things-to-consider-in-pitch">Other things to consider in pitch</h2>

<p>Especially if pitching to a broadcaster.</p>

<h3 id="cross-platformonline-interactive-ideasceond-screen-options">5-Cross platform/online interactive idea/sceond screen options.</h3>

<div class="well">
<p>A lot of Mark’s trips and tricks require using websites and forums to exchange ideas, as well as unwanted commodities, skills and expertise.</p>
<p>An example is the freecyle mailing list, where people give away things they no longer want in their house (ranging from a fridge to a couch etc…).</p>
An online presence for this program would be an app where the viewer can look for alternative ways to do things for free, contextually categorised by their geolocation, linking to other freecyclers and initiatives in their area.
</div>

<h3 id="slot-channel-audience">6-Slot, Channel, Audience.</h3>

<div class="well">
<p>I believe that the teenage and young adult audience responds to programmes that show how we are all increasingly connected, how our day-to-day decisions have global effects, and why we should care about this. Which is why I think this programme would fit well with the BBC3 audience range of 16 to 34.</p>
<p>This age range is also interested in re-defining what it means to have a successful life and career, questioning and looking for alternatives to their parents’ generation. This programme will explore alternative lifestyles, and confront the challenges around stepping out of the mainstream.</p>
</div>

<p>if y
TV schedule, difference between broadcasters.
Research the channels.</p>

<p>Examples </p>

<ul>
  <li>BBC1 - flagship</li>
  <li>BBC2 - individual/family</li>
  <li>BBC3 - younger audience, topics made accessible, generally group of youngsters on a journey, or hip presnter led.</li>
  <li>BBC4 - older audience, more culture.</li>
  <li>C4 - quirky and provocative </li>
  <li>ITV</li>
  <li>BBC Radio4 - Radio documentaries</li>
  <li>Sky One - </li>
  <li>Aljazeera UK - Docs 30min to 1 hour. upcoming</li>
  <li>NFBC, Canada and indigenous </li>
  <li>ARTE, france doc, and interactive doc.(?)</li>
</ul>

<p>[look at broadcast now commissioning editor page?]</p>

<p>Think coproductions, ie HBO / Storyville, ARTE. </p>

<p>As for the audience, once you worked out slot for a channel, and targeted audience, some market research reports ie cassandra report, help you put it into context.
Also look into the Research Center.</p>

<p>But this could also be a video for the website of a local radio station, ie Biomassa, Radio citta del capo, already covering the subject, so have audience interested in knowing a bit more of an investigation into it but not necessarily from a hard journalistic point of view.</p>

<p>example 2, the swing rowers, would have not pitch that to Radio citta del capo, went to Resonance FM instead, as music based, but also talk and culture, also they had no problem in having first language italian with subtitles for the video. and radio episode in italian without translation.(had intermissions of music.)</p>

<h3 id="access">7- Access</h3>

<p>Last but not least, exclusive access to unprecedented contributor, location, etc..</p>

<h3 id="title">8-  Title</h3>
<p>Come up with a cracking, I deliberatly put it here cos it might be easier to first brainstorm the story and delineate the other aspects and then shrink it down to title and topline, but you’d have to see what works for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep it short, 3 to 4 words.</li>
  <li>does what it says on the thin.</li>
  <li>entice the viewer,(aware of the targeted viewer)</li>
  <li>sets the expectations, </li>
</ul>

<div class="well">
"Live Free for a Month"
</div>

<p>Topline:</p>

<div class="well">
Going Moneyless with the moneyless man.
</div>

<hr />

<h1 id="treatment---written">Treatment - written</h1>
<p>repeat thinks from pitch + add story arc, make hypothesis of what could happen, twist and turns, ie think 3 act structur.</p>

<div class="well">
Example channel swim. or swingrowers.
</div>

<hr />

<h1 id="verbal-pitch">Verbal Pitch</h1>

<p>Take your written pitch, and answer the following using keywords.(thinking up what the whole sentence for each would be thou). Then re-iterate on it until it sinks in, in your own words. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Title </li>
  <li>Narrative, what drives the journey? - carachter and inciting icident.</li>
  <li>Access(include in the one above)</li>
  <li>What will we see? </li>
  <li>Why we doing it?</li>
  <li>What are we exploring?</li>
  <li>Slot, Channel, Audience.</li>
  <li>Cross platform/online interactive idea/sceond screen options.</li>
</ol>

<p>when feel ready try with timer. and tailor it to specific pitching sessions requirements.</p>

<p>ps: sounds obvious but If using powerpoint, or have things to show, slides, Taster tape etc.. make sure the room you’ll be pitching has the tech you need. and think contingecy plan.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="taster-tape">Taster Tape</h1>

<p>ie the English Surgeon 
show you have a compelling Carachter, less about production value, more about carchter and story, and weather it works on screen. also proving it’s for the screen and not radio or print.</p>

<p>if possible the inciting incident.</p>

<p>actuality or ie “talk while doing”.</p>
