So was that a bad idea?
What might had been either the biggest f** up or the greatest idea.

Embarrassing early designs 


- numbers / excell - keynote prototype



- bad or good idea?

I probably wouldn't do it again, but was it a bad idea?


Let's see what happened 

Hyperaudio 

Predit 

BBC natural history system 

Others?


None of them solved the issue. 
1.
Predict sucked, no clear way to organize 

Also you already needed to have transcriptions, and setup was tedious.

You know when someone starts the sentence with " you need to have the transcript in the same folder as the video with the same same name" you are starting of with the wrong foot.
" excuse me? where I store files on my system or how I name them should not be any of anyone's concern, sort out an import and rename function for the user if that's the starting point of your app, for crying out loud"

Xml only supported by Final Cut Pro 7.
Vs edl more widely compatible.

2.
Hyperaudio no input of video except for YouTube and no export of video or edl just removable embed.

Palestinian remix can do that, follow up project from that. 

Idea of hyper transcript ( although initial thinking of html as a data structure makes me ... Everytime I see it)

But open source 
Obama romney used as Foundation For Hackaton  at times (won) 

So was that a bad idea?

Let's consider another one 
- Hyperaudio them morphed into trint 

Shared edl module I made open source with them, and they integrated it with their system( although trint is commercial and close source the devs are cool open source minded folks ) and made light and export + preview.

When had to scale back down, that came back to mind .

They implemented adding span a round selection, I gave class to span words. 

Meant it was easier to unselect and concat new selection with older one when contiguous. Adding word number just compare of current == next - 1. 
If not, not contiguous and can split selection.
This can be done on the fly with jquery.



- editing text 
Content editable x word vs all sentence + overhead of recalculating timecodes(and loosing a bit of accuracy)

Recurring theme is that Inspired by her solution I came up with an alternative one.like having your own outsourced R&D team, that you can consider, evaluate, disregard etc..


So was that a bad idea?
-  issue of preview video of an edl.

Their first solution they had was to have two video tags, line up next clip and switch when first end.
From user point if view was a pretty smooth experience. Except for when selecting short word to do cassette style remix.

I challenged them that from a CS point of view it was a pretty disgusting solution.

Challenge accepted 

They started talking about MP4 super fast editing with Stacey from internet archive by copying blocks and changing header, no transcoding. So fast.

Tech implementation well above my head but one day Laurianne said oh here is an npm module that does that. No wait it sucks. I'll do my own and sbam he made it and open sourced it.
To which I could ask to keep it unopionated to work with webm as well.

I got a module that did no existed an a super sleek solution to a very good problem.

- so was it a bad idea?

Final slide: 

Tesla strategy to open source design to encourage competitors to enter the market with trust that they can still be the best and raise above the competition.

Crazy Or genius?

Erik ries - "successful entrepreneurs have better processes, not necessary better ideas"

My final thought is that "What goes a round comes a round"
