I am freelance shooting researcher, with expirience working on broadcast documentaries for Discovery Channel, Nat Geo and corporate productions for Google.
and recently been taken on the BBC Production Talent Pool.

I've also recently spent sometime in a 3 month dev bootcamp learning how to code on ruby on rails.
