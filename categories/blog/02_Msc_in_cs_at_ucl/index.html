	<!-- # So you are starting an Msc in CS at UCL... -->
<p>Following from <a href="">so you want to learn to code</a>,</p>
<p>If you have patiently project after project powered through CS50, well done :)</p>
<p>Now, congrats on your offer, let's see how you can make the most off this one year at UCL.</p>
<p>MB: the course might have changed from when I took it and when you are reading this, so try to abstract the overaching strategy from the specifics.</p>
<h2>before starting</h2>
<p>First thing first, read up on Java.
You can think of the First module GC01 as a boot camp in Java, with classes guiding you through main chapters of Graham's book up to chapter 10(?), and labs tutorial exercises to consolidate key aspects leading up to a group project Desktop app in Java swing.
It will be fun but brace yourself.</p>
<p>Start reading Graham's book at least 6 months before starting the course, don't worry if you get stuck on don't understand aim for a first pass.
Other books worth looking at to re-visit same topics in different lights are ( Java books used last year).</p>
<p>Bonus point do some small exercises in Java, download Graham's code and play a round with it.</p>
<p>Bonus point setup eclipse.</p>
<p>And that's it, if you got time familiarise yourself with javacript, eloquent is a good start.</p>
<h2>some math to learn before starting</h2>
<h2>strategy</h2>
<p>I found it very useful to use flash cards ( Amazon) erasable pens and a4 paper to consolidate my learning.</p>
<p>Some people find it useful to use Evernote. For me there is something in the act of writing that allows thugs to sync in.</p>
<p>Also things like flash cards to familiarise syntax, helped with speeding up the delay time before first being introduced to a concept of a syntax element</p>
<p>( examples of syntax cards I have)</p>
<p>You have to make your own, it's also the process that makes it personable.</p>
<p>Also fun ( and a bit geeky I guess but it does pay dividends ) to test others or being tested by others on flash cards in study group context.</p>
<p>Assume nothing, and you'd be fine or should I say make hypothesis when doing and learning and validate those hypothesis and you'd develop a great method to learn and do anything systematically.</p>
<h2>first term</h2>
<h3>gc01 - Java</h3>
<p>Use git as version control from very beginning use it from terminal, read documentation. At least first two chapters.</p>
<p>It might feel trivial with all that you are learning forwards the end to learn about automatic generating documentation but it will pay up later on, especially the evergreen such as what are good comments convention for documentation and what Iof that can be automated and what you need to do yourself.</p>
<p>Write some on what you learned about this, it will be useful in several months times.</p>
<h3>gc02 - app</h3>
<p>You'd problly need to decide on your stack based on the needs of the project but as a fallback for a Web app, html5, CSS3, JavaScript, + a language to connect to db, such as Python or php would go along way.</p>
<p>If feeling are feeling brave a framework such as laravel php, Python django, and Ruby on Rails could be interesting if the learning curve is not going to indure.</p>
<p>Read design patterns, head first and gang of 4. Great emphasis in report about how you used those. ( if you use a framework you can describe how this uses those)
Easier to refactor into patterns then using them from scratch.</p>
<h3>gc03 system - OS</h3>
<p>6th edition of book, and question at end of chapter come up in exam.</p>
<ul>
<li>better written, much more clear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>gc03 system - compilers</h3>
<p>Stanford compilers course, first part great intro to regex and other parts.
And understand automata.</p>
<p>You can use var when writing in regex( notes from prep to exam + my blog post)</p>
<h3>gc03 - database</h3>
<p>SQL query practice on demo one from course.
W3School SQL , has interactive demo to try queries.
and code academy class
https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-sql</p>
<p>(other?)</p>
<h2>term 2</h2>
<h3>gc05 algo and data structures</h3>
<p>Watch lynda.com and read spirit Of algo Christmas break or before starting in September.</p>
<p>Make time to be on top of it as course goes  along, watch over screencast of classes.</p>
<p>And code implementation described, make your own paper  sketches to visualise diagram of implantation.
Make study group to discuss this.</p>
<p>What you learn here is huge part of what they ask in tech interviews.</p>
<p>For second theory part of course for exam bank on math even if not for math background and attend all of seminar and ask to do past papers exercises.
Questions repeat themselves and with practice and a bit if math refresher  you can nail it. &quot; easily&quot;.</p>
<h2>option module - imentreprenurship</h2>
<p>Look at specs is more about validating the idea and apply lean, mum test etc then actually building the product.
Don't underestimate understanding how to do market analyses.</p>
<p>Plan haed to do the required interviews.</p>
<p>Group projects are great but doing it along if you got a clear ideas might help you with balancing time with other classes.</p>
<h2>functional programming</h2>
<p>I took this, but might be worth taking something easier to have more time for gf05.</p>
<p>However hard this is one in a lifetime opportunity to spend some time on functional. This will stand out on cv.
And is transferable on js.</p>
<p>Aim of this for exam is to get to working knowledge of Miranda and fictional that you can think and solve problems with it.</p>
<p>Go over and pay attention to first two weeks on lambda calculus, he does a great introduction. And it sets everything up for the rest , all the underlying assumptions and logic.</p>
<h2>Exams Prep</h2>
<p>identify most recurrent questions</p>
<p>(finding from 2015)</p>
<h2>final project</h2>
<p>Try and get a placement or organise it yourself on something that you feel strongly motivated about, you'll need it.</p>
<p>Go to meet ups on things that interest you, small time commitment but might help in finding an interesting project with interesting client ( although does not not have to be payed) be picky, your time is valuable.</p>
<p>Learn about testing, through Graham 's chapter as early as possible beam cause there's a whole cheater of it in the report.</p>
<p>Keep log notes, of what you do, what you learn, what you don't understand.
Sometimes when you hit a roadblock, stoping and writing it down, describing its nature, it's the first step to solve it. + if it is interesting can give you something to write about in the report.</p>
<p>See your supervisor once a week.</p>
<p>Leave 2 to 3 weeks for final write up.</p>
<p>Good idea to open source project and make GitHub page with demo( or closest thing to it) as well as screenshots , user manual page and link to documentation</p>
<p>Automate writing documentation process, as well as its deployment.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Bash scripting is your friend when it comes to automate deployment or testing.</p>
<p>Learn to read documentation , it's dry, but find a system that works for you.</p>
<p>Example of evergree, learn HTTP for it's own sake
book &quot;HTTP: The Definitive Guide&quot;
