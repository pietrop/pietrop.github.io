The JSON Form Schema Design Pattern is a way to simplify working with dynamic forms in web apps. Instead of hard-coding every form element, you define a JSON schemas. This means your forms are consistent, reusable, and way easier to manage. The architecture includes form logic, rendering, and validation, so things stay well organized. 

There are a few well known libraries, but when implemented from scratch the pattern is often misunderstood. 

So I made a learning resource that provides an overview of the pattern and a code walk through of a possible implementation. See the project's [storybook intro doc for more info](https://pietropassarelli.net/json-form-schema-design-pattern).
