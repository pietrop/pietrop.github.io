As part of a paper edit workflow you can get your interviews transcribed by youtube captions, and then upload them onto google spreadhseet to do make a selection and share them with collaborators. 

The weakest link in the chain is turning the .sbv file from youtube into a .csv that can be uploaded onto google spreadsheet. I am not going to go into details about this now, but let's just say that the workflow involved find and replace in word and passing a `.txt` file into excell, and even then there was a los of accuracy in the process.

So I wrote this quick ruby script that can be run from the terminal to format captons/transcriptions(`.sbv`) generated by youtube into a `.csv` file that can be uploaded seamesly onto a google spreadsheet without needing further formatting. As mentioned This is part of a prototype for a paper editing workflow.
