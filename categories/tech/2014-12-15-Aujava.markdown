This was a group project in a team of 3, and also included an HCI component of making sketches and mockups and establishing user requirements.

This was the high fidelity java mockup using swing [before implementing the app in ruby on rails]({{site.url}}/Audava.html) as part of the UCL Msc CS course requirements.


It used an XML as database to store the application state in between sessions.
