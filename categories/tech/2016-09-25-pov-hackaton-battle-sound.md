Using outtakes from a documentary on DJ culture, re imagining what would the "dvd extras" look like as an interactive. And exploring interfaces for making a timeline where viewers can explore the footage behind the edits.

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt="{{ page.description }}" />
</div>

Used autoEdit2 to speed up the  making of the hypertranscript.
Using github pages, and a google spreadsheet as "backend", [see R&D Notes for more info](https://github.com/pietrop/BattleSounds/blob/master/notes.md). Also [slides of presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19TB4CpkCDqMJQvhmZF3I9AN7IQ0VsIA8nsfpdHkfDss/edit?usp=sharing).


<!-- 
Some notes on what to write about 

TODO: Add video 

 -->
For a given clip it shows you the source media used to make the edit and allows you to click on it, and bring it up and view the full length of the original it belongs to.

I used a google spreadsheet as backend so that the rest of the team could keep curating the editorial side of things while I refined the front-end interaction with the designer.
