Leveraging the setup from [Opened Caption rig](/opened-captions-annotated-article-rig.html) reporters can collaborate and annotated a live stream transcription from C-Span into a google doc. 
The text is then exported and parsed to create an annotated transcription. 
At Vox this was first created and used for the Trump Inauguration Speech of January 2017.  See [Opened Caption rig](/opened-captions-annotated-article-rig.html) for more details.


Common approach by other publications was to pay a stenographer ~ 100$ an hour of the duration fo the live speech to obtain the transcription. Leveraging opened captions server, to get C-Span captions from Tv this cut the cost down to 0$.
