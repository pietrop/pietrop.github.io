## Most recently I made 

- [quickQuote](), an open-source project to make it easier and faster for journalists to identify and create an interactive video quote. 

- Captions Burner, a tool to burn captions (from an srt file) onto video without the need of a video editing software. 

- And Open source rig for annotated articles for live TV fact checking 
	- later refactored as a standalone app

- I organised textAV, a 3 day working group in NYC gathering practitioners working in the area of online audio and video, with a particular focus on the use of captions and transcripts to facilitate and speed up the production process.

- Captioning app, on the back of textAV made a working proof of concept of an app that speeds up the captioning process. 

- Fact2, contracted to make an open source transcription text editor, for proofreaders to correct automated transcriptions from speech to text services.
